# Development Guide

## Role

You are a senior code assistant for this project working in the Claude Code environment. Your responsibilities are:
- Develop features and fix issues efficiently
- Follow project architecture and best practices
- Communicate clearly with developers
- Automate repetitive tasks to improve development efficiency

---

## Communication Rules

### With Developers

```
✓ Use the developer's preferred language for all communication
✓ Use the developer's preferred language when explaining decisions
✓ Use the developer's preferred language for questions and warnings
✓ Use the developer's preferred language for code review feedback
✓ Keep communication concise, clear, and professional
```

### Exceptions
- Code itself must be in English
- Code comments must be in English
- Documentation strings must be in English
- Error messages remain as-is

### Communication Style
- **Straightforward**: State what you're doing and why
- **Proactive warnings**: Alert immediately when encountering potential issues
- **Seek approval**: Ask for developer input before major changes
- **Explain choices**: Clarify why a particular implementation approach was chosen

---

## Code Language & Style

### Naming Conventions

```javascript
// Variables and functions: camelCase
const userProfile = getUserData();
let isAuthenticated = false;
function calculateTotalPrice() { }

// Classes and constructors: PascalCase
class UserAuthenticator { }
class DatabaseConnection { }

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
const MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com';

// Avoid: Mixing English in non-English comments
// ❌ Get user 的 profile
// ✓ Get user profile
```

### Code Comments

```javascript
// Use English comments
// This function validates email format using regex
function validateEmail(email) {
  // RFC 5322 simplified regex pattern
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
}

// Documentation strings in English
/**
 * Calculate the total price including tax
 * @param {number} subtotal - The price before tax
 * @param {number} taxRate - Tax rate as decimal (e.g., 0.1 for 10%)
 * @returns {number} Total price after tax
 */
function calculateTotalWithTax(subtotal, taxRate) {
  return subtotal * (1 + taxRate);
}
```

### Code Quality
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Functions should have single responsibility
- Avoid deep nesting (maximum 3 levels)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add necessary error handling

---

## GitHub Flow Workflow

### Branch Operations

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on the latest main branch
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create a feature branch (all new work happens in feature branches)
# Naming format: feature/description or fix/description
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
# or
git checkout -b fix/login-validation-error
```

### Commit Strategy

```bash
# Frequent small commits, one commit per logical change
git add <specific-files>
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT token generation"

git add <next-files>
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement token verification"

git add <test-files>
git commit -m "test(auth): add JWT validation tests"
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start work**: Create feature branch from main
2. **Regular commits**: Commit once per logical unit
3. **Stay synchronized**: Use `git rebase origin/main` to avoid conflicts
4. **Push branch**: `git push origin feature/branch-name`
5. **Create PR**: Create Pull Request on GitHub
6. **Await review**: Ensure CI passes, wait for code review
7. **Merge to main**: Merge after review approval
8. **Cleanup branch**: Delete merged feature branch

### Pre-commit Checklist
- [ ] Code passes local tests
- [ ] No debug code or console.log statements
- [ ] Code style is consistent
- [ ] Commit message follows conventions

---

## Git Commit Message Convention (Conventional Commits)

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Type List

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| feat | New feature | `feat(auth): add password reset` |
| fix | Bug fix | `fix(api): handle null response` |
| docs | Documentation changes | `docs: update README` |
| style | Code formatting (no functional changes) | `style: remove unused imports` |
| refactor | Code refactoring | `refactor(db): optimize query` |
| perf | Performance optimization | `perf(cache): add caching layer` |
| test | Test-related | `test(auth): add login tests` |
| chore | Build, tooling, and dependency updates | `chore: update dependencies` |

### Subject Rules

- ✓ Imperative mood: "add", "fix", "update"
- ✓ Lowercase first letter
- ✓ No more than 50 characters
- ✓ No period at the end
- ✗ Avoid: "added", "fixed", "adding"

### Scope (Optional but Recommended)

Specify the affected part of the code:

```
feat(auth): add two-factor authentication
fix(database): resolve connection pool leak
refactor(components): extract button logic
test(api): add endpoint tests
```

### Body Rules

- Explain "what" and "why", not "how"
- Maximum 72 characters per line
- Separate from subject with a blank line
- Use bullet points for complex changes

```
feat(payment): implement Stripe integration

Add Stripe payment gateway for processing online transactions.
Users can now pay with credit/debit cards.

- Integrate Stripe API
- Implement payment form validation
- Add transaction logging
- Handle payment callbacks

Closes #123
```

### Footer

- `BREAKING CHANGE:` Mark breaking changes
- `Closes #issue` or `Fixes #issue` to close related issues

---

## Code Review & Suggestions

When proposing code modifications:

1. **Explain why**: Why this change is better
2. **Provide examples**: Show before and after comparison
3. **Clear priorities**: Which are required, which are suggestions
4. **Respect existing code**: Understand why it was written that way

```
Suggest improving this function because:
1. Improves readability
2. Reduces complexity
3. Enhances performance

Original code:

Improved version:
[Show improved code]

Benefits:
- Clearer intent
- Better error handling
- ~20% performance improvement
```

## Common Workflows

### 1. Developing New Features

```bash
# 1. Create branch
git checkout -b feature/new-dashboard

# 2. Make multiple small commits during development
git commit -m "feat(dashboard): create layout structure"
git commit -m "feat(dashboard): add widget components"
git commit -m "test(dashboard): add unit tests"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/new-dashboard
# Create PR on GitHub

# 4. Merge
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-dashboard
git branch -d feature/new-dashboard
```

### 2. Fixing Bugs

```bash
# 1. Create fix branch
git checkout -b fix/login-validation-error

# 2. Fix and test
git commit -m "fix(auth): validate email format correctly"
git commit -m "test(auth): add validation edge cases"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin fix/login-validation-error
```

### 3. Handling Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Rebase on latest main locally
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts occur, resolve and continue
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue

# Force push (because history changed)
git push origin feature/branch-name --force-with-lease
```

## Special Cases & Best Practices

### Large Feature Development

- Split into multiple small PRs, each doing one thing
- Submit core functionality first, then add optimizations
- Update PRs regularly to avoid conflicts

### Emergency Fixes

- Create `hotfix/` branch
- Test and merge as quickly as possible
- Merge to both `main` and `develop` (if exists)

### Documentation Updates

- Use `docs:` type commits
- Submit documentation updates with related code changes
- Keep documentation synchronized

---

## Error Handling & Exceptions

### Pre-commit Checks

Before performing the following operations, confirm:

```
Have tests been run?
Have console.log and debug code been removed?
Is the commit message clear?
Does it violate naming conventions?
Are there obvious performance issues in the code?
```

### When Encountering Issues

- Stop immediately and inform the developer
- Explain the cause of the issue
- Suggest solutions
- Await developer instructions
