# Specification: Adapter Registry & Orchestration

## Overview
Define how adapters are registered, managed, and orchestrated to verify claims across multiple sources.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement 1: Adapter Registry
Central management of registered adapters with metadata and lifecycle control.

#### Scenario: Register adapter on initialization
- **WHEN** FactGate is initialized with adapter configuration
- **THEN** each adapter is registered in the registry
- **AND** the registry stores adapter name, description, and instance
- **AND** the registry maintains adapter metadata (weight, timeout, priority)
- **AND** the registry validates adapter interface compliance
- **AND** initialization fails with clear error if adapter is invalid

#### Scenario: List registered adapters
- **WHEN** querying the registry for adapter information
- **THEN** it returns all registered adapters
- **AND** each entry includes name, description, and availability status
- **AND** it can filter adapters by category or type
- **AND** it provides adapter reliability metrics if available
- **AND** listing does not trigger verification

#### Scenario: Add adapter at runtime
- **WHEN** adding a new adapter after initialization
- **THEN** the registry validates the adapter interface
- **AND** the adapter is available for subsequent verifications
- **AND** existing verifications are unaffected
- **AND** the new adapter can be removed without affecting system stability

#### Scenario: Remove adapter at runtime
- **WHEN** an adapter is removed from the registry
- **THEN** it's immediately unavailable for new verifications
- **AND** in-flight verifications complete normally
- **AND** removing an adapter doesn't crash the system
- **AND** other adapters continue functioning

### Requirement 2: Parallel Verification Orchestration
Coordinate verification across multiple adapters efficiently.

#### Scenario: Execute adapters in parallel
- **WHEN** verifying a claim with multiple adapters
- **THEN** all adapters verify the claim concurrently
- **AND** adapters don't block each other
- **AND** results are collected as they complete
- **AND** overall verification time is ~= longest adapter time
- **AND** parallelization is transparent to callers

#### Scenario: Respect adapter timeouts
- **WHEN** an adapter is slow or hanging
- **THEN** FactGate enforces the configured timeout
- **AND** timeout defaults to 500ms per adapter
- **AND** timeout can be configured per adapter
- **AND** timeout expiry returns partial results from completed adapters
- **AND** timed-out adapter is marked as unavailable in result

#### Scenario: Set max concurrent adapters
- **WHEN** FactGate has many adapters
- **THEN** it can limit concurrent executions
- **AND** default max concurrency is 10 adapters
- **AND** this prevents resource exhaustion
- **AND** excess adapters queue and run after others complete
- **AND** queuing doesn't affect result accuracy

#### Scenario: Handle adapter failures gracefully
- **WHEN** an adapter throws an error during verification
- **THEN** the error is caught and logged
- **AND** the error doesn't crash the verification process
- **AND** the error doesn't prevent other adapters from running
- **AND** the failed adapter is marked in the result
- **AND** verification completes with results from other adapters

### Requirement 3: Result Aggregation & Combination
Combine results from multiple adapters into final verification result.

#### Scenario: Aggregate verification results
- **WHEN** multiple adapters complete verification
- **THEN** all results are collected
- **AND** results are passed to the confidence scorer
- **AND** combined result includes all individual adapter results
- **AND** combined result includes aggregated confidence and verdict
- **AND** combined result includes reasoning for final decision

#### Scenario: Include all source results
- **WHEN** returning aggregated verification result
- **THEN** the response includes individual results from each adapter
- **AND** users can see which adapters agreed/disagreed
- **AND** users can see individual confidence scores
- **AND** users can see individual reasoning
- **AND** full transparency is provided for audit purposes

#### Scenario: Order results by confidence
- **WHEN** presenting multiple source results
- **THEN** results are ordered by confidence (highest first)
- **AND** contradictory results are adjacent for comparison
- **AND** uncertain results are grouped separately
- **AND** ordering aids user understanding of verification strength

### Requirement 4: Claim Processing Optimization
Optimize verification through caching and deduplication.

#### Scenario: Cache recent claims
- **WHEN** the same claim is verified multiple times
- **THEN** results are cached from first verification
- **AND** cached results are returned immediately (no re-verification)
- **AND** cache is configurable with TTL (default 1 hour)
- **AND** cache size is bounded to prevent memory issues
- **AND** cache can be disabled for real-time verification

#### Scenario: Handle cache expiration
- **WHEN** cached result reaches TTL
- **THEN** it's removed from cache
- **AND** subsequent verification triggers new checking
- **AND** expiration is transparent to callers
- **AND** cache statistics are available for debugging

#### Scenario: Deduplicate concurrent requests
- **WHEN** multiple concurrent requests for same claim
- **THEN** only one verification executes
- **AND** all requesters receive same result
- **AND** duplicate requests queue and reuse result
- **AND** this prevents redundant adapter calls

### Requirement 5: Error Handling & Resilience
Comprehensive error handling for adapter failures and system issues.

#### Scenario: Handle adapter unavailability
- **WHEN** an adapter is permanently unavailable
- **THEN** FactGate can recover and use other adapters
- **AND** unavailable adapter is marked via circuit breaker
- **AND** circuit breaker prevents repeated failing calls
- **AND** circuit breaker can be reset manually
- **AND** system continues functioning with reduced sources

#### Scenario: Provide meaningful error messages
- **WHEN** verification encounters errors
- **THEN** error messages are descriptive and actionable
- **AND** errors indicate which adapters failed
- **AND** errors suggest remediation steps
- **AND** errors are logged with context for debugging
- **AND** user receives useful information, not stack traces

#### Scenario: Validate input claims
- **WHEN** verifying a claim
- **THEN** FactGate validates claim input
- **AND** empty or null claims are rejected with clear error
- **AND** oversized claims (>100KB) are rejected
- **AND** invalid claim format is detected early
- **AND** validation errors don't propagate to adapters

### Requirement 6: Configuration & Customization
Flexible configuration for different verification scenarios.

#### Scenario: Configure aggregation strategy
- **WHEN** FactGate is initialized
- **THEN** aggregation strategy can be selected
- **AND** 'weighted-average' uses weighted confidence scores
- **AND** 'majority-vote' uses voting logic
- **AND** 'custom' allows user-defined aggregation
- **AND** strategy affects final confidence and verdict

#### Scenario: Set adapter weights
- **WHEN** configuring adapters
- **THEN** each adapter can have a weight (0-1)
- **AND** weights influence confidence aggregation
- **AND** weights default to equal (1/n)
- **AND** weight configuration is validated
- **AND** weights are normalized automatically

#### Scenario: Configure timeouts
- **WHEN** FactGate is initialized
- **THEN** default timeout can be set globally
- **AND** timeout can be overridden per adapter
- **AND** timeout is enforced at orchestration layer
- **AND** timeout configuration is validated
- **AND** insufficient timeout is warned
